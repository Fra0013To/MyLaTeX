	abstract= {{In this paper, a rectangular aerostatic bearing with multiple supply holes is optimised with a multiobjective optimisation approach. The design variables taken into account are the supply holes position, their number and diameter, the supply pressure, while the objective functions are the load capacity, the air consumption and the stiffness and damping coefficients. A genetic algorithm is applied in order to find the Pareto set of solutions. The novelty with respect to other optimisations which can be found in literature is that number and location of the supply holes is completely free and not associated to a pre-defined scheme. A vector x associated with the supply holes location is introduced in the design parameters and given in input to the optimizer.}},

	abstract = {In the framework of flow simulations in Discrete Fracture Networks, we consider the problem of identifying possible backbones, namely preferential channels in the network. Backbones can indeed be fruitfully used to analyze clogging or leakage, relevant for example in waste storage problems, or to reduce the computational cost of simulations. With a suitably trained Neural Network at hand, we use the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation as a feature selection method to detect the expected relevance of each fracture in a Discrete Fracture Network and thus identifying the backbone.}
