	abstract = {This paper investigates uncertain maximum flow problem. To obtain the uncertainty distribution of the maximum flow, an α-maximum flow model is formulated under uncertainty theory framework. It is proved that there exists an equivalence relationship between the α-maximum flow model and the classic deterministic maximum flow model. Furthermore, some important properties of α-maximum flow model are analyzed, based on which a polynomial algorithm is proposed. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the model and the algorithm.}

	abstract = {We consider a generic maximum flow interdiction problem that involves a leader and a follower who take actions in sequence. Given an interdiction budget, the leader destroys a subset of arcs to minimize the follower’s maximum flows from a source to a sink node. The effect from an interdiction action taken on each arc is random, following a given success rate of decreasing the arc’s capacity to zero. The follower can add additional arc capacities for mitigating flow losses, after knowing the leader’s interdiction plan but before realizing the uncertainty. We consider risk-neutral and risk-averse behaviors of the two players and investigate five bi-level/tri-level programming models for different risk-preference combinations. The models incorporate the expectation, left-tail, and right-tail Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as commonly used convex risk measures for evaluating random maximum flows in the leader’s and follower’s objectives. We reformulate each model as an equivalent mixed-integer linear program and test them on real-world network instances to demonstrate interactions between the leader and the follower under various risk-preference settings.}

The randomization is used to efficiently play a certain combinatorial game that arises during the computation. We give a version of their algorithm where a general version of their game arises. Then we give a strategy for the game that yields a deterministic algorithm for computing the maximum flow in a directed graph with n nodes and m edges that runs in time O(mn(logm/n log nn)). Our algorithm gives an O(mn) deterministic algorithm for all m/n = Ω(nϵ) for any positive constant ϵ, and is currently the fastest deterministic algorithm for computing maximum flow as long as m/n = ω(log n).}
