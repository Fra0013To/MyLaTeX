abstract={Heuristic search procedures that aspire to find global optimal solutions to hard combinatorial optimization problems usually require some type of diversification to overcome local optimality. One way to achieve diversification is to re-start the procedure from a new solution once a region has been explored. In this chapter we describe the best known multi-start methods for solving optimization problems. We propose classifying these methods in terms of their use of randomization, memory and degree of rebuild. We also present a computational comparison of these methods on solving the linear ordering problem in terms of solution quality and diversification power.},

After a brief introduction on random-search techniques, a more detailed analysis is carried out on the application of simulated annealing to continuous global optimization. The aim of such an analysis is mainly that of presenting recent papers on the subject, which have received only scarce attention in the most recent published surveys. Finally a very brief presentation of clustering techniques is given. {\textcopyright} 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {The new computational technologies are having a very strong influence on numerical optimization, in several different ways. Many researchers have been stimulated by the need to either conform the existing numerical techniques to the new parallel architectures or to devise completely new parallel solution approaches. A mini-symposium on Parallel Computing in Nonlinear Optimization was held in Naples, Italy, September 2001, during the International Conference ParCo2001, in order to bring together researchers active in this field and to discuss and share their findings. Some of the papers presented during the mini-symposium, as well as additional contributions from other researchers are collected in this special issue. Clearly, two different trends, well representative for most of the current research activities, can be identified. Firstly, there is an attempt to encapsulate parallel linear algebra software and algorithms into optimization codes, particularly codes implementing interior point strategies for which the linear algebra issues are very critical, and secondly, there is an effort to devise new parallel solution strategies in global optimization, either for specific or general purpose problems, motivated by the large size and the combinatorial nature of them. In the present paper we review the literature on these trends and classify the contributed papers within this framework.}

@article{Mathesen2021,
abstract = {A common approach to global optimization is to combine local optimization methods with random restarts. Restarts have been used as a performance boosting approach. They can be a means to avoid “slow progress” by exploiting a potentially good solution, and restarts can enable the potential discovery of multiple local solutions, thus improving the overall quality of the returned solution. A multi-start method is a way to integrate local and global approaches; where the global search itself can be used to restart a local search. Bayesian optimization methods aim to find global optima of functions that can only be point-wise evaluated by means of a possibly expensive oracle. We propose the stochastic optimization with adaptive restart (SOAR) framework, that uses the predictive capability of Gaussian process models as a means to adaptively restart local search and intelligently select restart locations with current information. This approach attempts to balance exploitation with exploration of the solution space. We study the asymptotic convergence of SOAR to a global optimum, and empirically evaluate SOAR performance through a specific implementation that uses the Trust Region method as the local search component. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methodologies over a suite of test problems of varying problem dimension with a finite budget of function evaluations.},

abstract = {The unconstrained global programming problem is addressed using a multistart, multialgorithminfrastructure, in which different algorithms compete in parallel for a contribution towards a single global stopping criterion, denoted the unified Bayesian global stopping criterion. The use of different algorithms is motivated by the observation that no single (global) optimization algorithm consistently outperforms all other algorithms when applied to large sets of problems from different classes. The Bayesian stopping criterion is based on the single assumption that the probability of each algorithm converging to the global optimum is at least as large as the probability of convergence to any other local minimum. This assumption is often valid in the case of practical problems of physical origin (e.g., determining physical configurations corresponding to minimum potential energy). Results for parallel clusters of up to 128 machines are presented.}

The classical Rosenbrock function, which is a two-dimensional unimodal function, has been extended to higher dimensions in recent years. Many researchers take the high-dimensional Rosenbrock function as a unimodal function by instinct. In 2001 and 2002, Hansen and Deb found that the Rosenbrock function is not a unimodal function for higher dimensions although no theoretical analysis was provided. This paper shows that the n-dimensional (n = 4 ∼ 30) Rosenbrock function has 2 minima, and analysis is proposed to verify this. The local minima in some cases are presented. In addition, this paper demonstrates that one of the “local minima” for the 20-variable Rosenbrock function found by Deb might not in fact be a local minimum.},
